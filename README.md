# UNIFIED_backend
We need to Set up a new Django project and app forFirst, create a new Django project and a new app within that project. In this example, the project will be called "credapp" and the app will be called "billpay".
Create a models.py file in the billpay app
In the models.py file, define the models for the unified bill pay system. At a minimum, you'll need models for Users, Bills, and Payments.
Run migrations to create the database schema
Create views for the app
Create a views.py file in the billpay app and define views for listing bills, creating payments, etc
Create templates for the views
Create a templates folder in the billpay app and add HTML templates for the views
Set up URL routing
Edit the urls.py file in the credapp project to include URL patterns for the billpay app
Create a new urls.py file in the billpay app and define the URL patterns for the views
Add form validation
Create a forms.py file in the billpay app and define a form for creating payments with validation logic
After successfully saving all these py files in their respective directories and successful compilation, the unified bill pay feature is updated 
This is a step by step procedure on how the project is going to work.
